# :snowflake: Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my submissions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/).

My primary submissions were in Python and are available in the `python` directory. I also attempted some  days 
in Rust which are available in the `rust` directory.

Merry Christmas :snowman:!
